jailinit serves a replacement for FreeBSD's init(8), for use in "virtual systems" started by a jail(2) system call and more specifically the jail(8) userland tool in FreeBSD.  If you use jail(8) to launch the "virtual system", the application you should launch within the jailed hierarchy is /sbin/init (which you replaced with jailinit).  This init replacement will function as you expect - bringing the system into a mutli-user state and handling /etc/rc for runtime configurations as usual.  This init replacement will also accept signals from outside the jail (or inside it) for the purpose of restarting or stopping the "virtual system".

PS: The last time I tested this was with FreeBSD 4.0-STABLE quite some time ago.
